A 3D printed, Raspberry Pi Pico powered macro keypad

I wanted a simple, but configurable macro keypad. The requirements were:
1) Layers for different apps.
2) A screen to remind me of what the current layer is mapped to. The screen should probably be angled/tiltable. It should use the pico display 2.0, because I have one in my drawer.
3) 3D printable design, so that it is made while I sleep.
4) No PCB, hand soldered.
5) No battery - USB connection.
6) RGB LED backlight for state indication.
